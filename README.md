## Running the project

To run the project, open one of the scenes, and use left click + hold (draw), release the clik when you are done.

## Importing the project

You can add this package as a git url : 
- "https://github.com/isirode/DrawingLines2D.git?path=/Assets/Isirode/DrawingLines2D#0.0.1".

The project will be added to your "Packages" folder, the scenes will be read-only, if you want to open them, just copy them in your Assets folder and they will be usable.

You can also download the .unitypackage of the version you want, here for instance https://github.com/isirode/DrawingLines2D/releases/tag/0.0.1 and add it manually to your project. 
This should import the project in your Assets folder.

## Know issues

They are cracks in the polygon composite collider (between each segments constituing the lines), it will be fixed in the future.
